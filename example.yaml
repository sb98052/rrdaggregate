# The list of aggregation recipes
# - Be default, all data is aggregated into one variable
# - To aggregate into multiple variables, enclose the part of the regular expression corresponding
#   to that variable in parenthesis.
# - You can group multiple items into parenthesis. In that case, you get w * y * ... z variables, where w, y, ... correspond to the number of unique occurrences of the grouped variables.

entries:
# Group the CPU utilization of all nodes into one variable
- name: cpu
  regex: node\d+\.princeton\.vicci\.org/cpu-\d+/cpu-idle.rrd
  ds: value
  fn: sum

# Group CPU utilization into variables corresponding to the node name.
- name: memory
  regex: (node\d+\.princeton\.vicci\.org)/memory/memory-used.rrd
